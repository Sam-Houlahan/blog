                <h4 class="ans">What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
                <p class="par">I had heard of this book before and it was amazing to read some of it and I will continue to read through it. I learned that there is ways that you can train the brain that I had never heard of especially the part about “neuroplasticity.”
                    The fact that you can change the structure of your brain through what you think,do and pay attention to is truly phenominal.</p>
                <h4 class="ans"> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
                <p class="par">It is an interesting concept. Since I have been trying to medidate each day I was already using similar techniques and they definately work.</p>

                <h4 class="ans">What is a grid based design?</h4>
                <p class="par"> A grid based design is a method used in design and web development. A grid design is used to improve consistency over the website. <br>This system is generally used when creating a responsive website. Using a css framework such as Bootstrap
                    will make this alot easier and will give you a professional responsive website. <br>Most websites use a grid based design,well all the websites I investigated had a grid based design. Generally speaking you would use a 12 column grid
                    in order to have a lot of flexibility with your website.</p>

                <h4 class="ans">What is all the hype behind responsive webpages?</h4 >
              <p class="par"> We are in a day and age where people generally have multiple devices with different screen sizes. Meaning that websites now need to be catered to all the devices otherwise your website will end up with less traffic.
              It is also the most cost effective way to build your website rather than spending resources to make a seperate mobile website you can just create one responsive site.</p>

              <h4 class="ans"> What is semantic structure?</h4>
                <p class="par">Using a semantic structure is important for web development as it will help the computer make meaning of your content. HTML5 includes tags called semantic elements, they give information about the type of content in these elements. For
                    example if you have a footer you would use the semantic tag "footer".

                </p>
                <h4 class="ans"> Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h4>
                <p class=par>I found it good to get some practice with placeholder images I can see them being helpful in the future!. I will also be adding CSS resetting to my website and future websites.</p>

                <h4 class="ans">Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM?<br> How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
                <p class="par"> My analogy would be to think of your webpage as a tree that has branches and flowers. The tree itself being HTML which has a body, head and elements as the branches. This is the main structure of a web page, now on this tree it has lots
                    of pretty colorful flowers this would be your CSS aka Cascading Style Sheet. Which is a language used to style a webpage. Our Tree needs to be visually created this is what I would refer to as the DOM aka Document Object Model which
                    is what your browser uses to visually build your page when you load it.</p>

                <h4 class="ans">What is meant by "Boxifying Design"?</h4 >
                <p class="par"> It is reffering to a technique commonly used as a web developer, as everything on a webpage is basically a box. <br>When you receive a design mockup you need divide it into boxes to figure out how you will grid and poistion everything
                    on the webpage.</p>

                <h4 class="ans"> What is the "Box Model"?</h4>
                <p class="par">All HTML documents are considered boxes. The box model is reffering to the design and layout of the css.<br> The CSS box model is basically a box that wraps around the page containing margins,borders,paddings and the content of your page.</p>
