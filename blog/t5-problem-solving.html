            <h3> Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:

<br>Got blocked on a simple problem
<br>Solved a problem in an elegant way
In both cases:</h3>
                        <p>This week I was blocked for awhile building last function of the dot game. The issue was resolved after realizing that I was infact selecting the right class however I did not realize I also needed to select the children of this class as well!. Children meaning all the elements inside the class.
                          In order to figure out this error I tried using the simple console.logging method after realizing this would be ineffective I used a breakpoint which is when you use the developer tools in your browser to select a point in your code to stop on. From here you can step to the next line and literally run through your function slow enough so the human eye can see.
                           With this method it makes it easy to see what your function is outputting and where your error starts happening and fix your bug. I learned that console.logging to fix a bug at times can't help you find your bug and that using developer tools is much more effective.</p>

                        <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
                      <ul>

<li>

  <strong>Psuedocode:</strong>
Psuedocoding feels very useful especially in the sense that you are explaining how your program will work in a human language and you also have something to refer to when coding.


</li><br>
<li>
  <strong>Trying something:</strong> This one is good and is pretty much what programming is you are forever trying something!.

</li><br>
<li>

  <strong> Rubber Ducky method:  </strong>
This is a good technique especially on major blockers or bugs.
 Explaining your issue to something or someone for some reason helps our brain figure out the issue. I had not heard of this method until starting this course but I now realise that I use this method in my current day to day job, which shows that this method can be used in all aspects of work/life.

</li><br>
 <li>
   <strong>Reading error messages:  </strong>
    This is generally the first step in debugging as reading the error message's can help you easily weasel out the small errors and syntax errors.
 </li><br>

 <li>
   <strong> Console.logging: </strong>
This was my go to method, however after this week I have learned that using breakpoints and debugger statements is much more effective.
 </li><br>

 <li>
   <strong>Googling: </strong>
   This definitely helps me solve some problems as generally someone else has definitely had the same error. Although we must keep in mind this method doesn't always work.

 </li><br>
 <li>
   <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>
I haven't had to do this yet but I am certain I will have to in the future. It is great to know I have peers that will definitely be willing to help me.
 </li><br>
 <li>
   <strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong>
This has been a good method as coaches at EDA are always very helpful!.
 </li><br>
 <li>
   <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong> This is definitely effective, I find myself later on when I'm not coding to be reflecting on the issue I had and how I fixed it or what I would do differently on that particular challenge or whatever it may have been.

 </li>






                      </ul>

                        <h3> Explain to your non-tech friend:  Array.prototype.filter( ), .map( ) and .reduce( )</h3>
                        <p>
                             .map() is used when you have an array and function and you want your function applied to every element in the array you would use .map().
                             Thus projecting your current array into a new one with your desired result.
                             <br> Example:
                             <br>incrementByOne= function (element) {
  return element + 1;
}<br>

myArray = [1,2,3,4];

<br>myArray.map(incrementByOne);    This would return you [2, 3, 4, 5 ].

                        </p>

                        <p> .filter() is used when you want to remove unwanted elements based on a condition. It is similar to .map() in the sense it goes through the array invoking a callback on each element. .filter()
                        will return a new array with the elements that have returned true against your condition. <br>Example:
                        <br>var ages = [20, 10, 9, 40];

<br> function checkAge(age) <br>{
    return age <= 10;
}   ages.filter(checkAge);  This would return you [10, 9 ].


                       </p>

                       <p> .reduce() is used when you want to go from a list of values and make them into one value. Pretty cool!.
                                                         <br>Example:
                                                         <br>var sum = [5, 6].reduce(
  function(total, num){ return total + num }
  ); <br>console.log(sum)  This would return you the sum of 11.<br><br>

  Learning these methods is going to be very helpful as will be more effective than building for loops for everything. I'm looking forward to experimenting with these more.
                       </p>
